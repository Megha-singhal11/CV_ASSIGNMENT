Features serve as input variables for the model, capturing relevant information from the data that aids in solving a specific task or problem. For example, in an image, features could be pixel values, edges, textures, or specific shapes that contribute to identifying objects or patterns. The selection and quality of features significantly impact the model's performance and its ability to learn and generalize."

The convolution operation involves element-wise multiplication of the overlapping regions of the input matrix and the kernel, followed by summing these products. This process is akin to matrix multiplication with a sliding window, where the window moves across the input, performing element-wise multiplications and summing the results. Thus, convolution can be conceptually understood as a local, sliding matrix multiplication."
